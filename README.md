## Technologies Used
- HTML - used to create elements on the DOM
- CSS - used to add style to the deployed page
- JavaScript - used to create the logic controlling the client-side application
- jQuery - library supplement to JavaScript controlling application logic
- Node.js - runtime environment which executes the JS code
- Express - framework for Node.js to create a server
- React - a JS library for building user interfaces
- JSX - similar to HTML, this can be used to structure component rendering within React
- Git - version control system to track changes to source code
- GitHub - hosts repository that can be deployed to GitHub Pages
- Heroku - host for deployed application

## Summary

This React application presented a fun challenge to do some reasearch while also explorating the creation of a simple memory game.  I chose to use blank memes to give a little humor to this exercise in memory.  Feel free to mentally come up with your own inane offerings while playing!

As for the more serious bit of this assignment, one of the more challenging tasks was creating a randomizer for the memes following the selection of each "card."  I did a little research on this and chose to go with the Fisherâ€“Yates-Durstenfeld Shuffle.  I'll spare the reader a history lesson, but the modern algorithm, if you would consider 1964 to be modern resembles the following, with ES6 syntax:

```  
memeShuffle = imageClick => {
    for (let i = imageClick.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
      let j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));
      let hold = imageClick[i]
      imageClick[i] = imageClick[j]
      imageClick[j] = hold
    }
  };
```

## Learning-Points

One of the more interesting learning points I picked up in this assignment, outside of all the syntatic drilling of how JSX is structured, and some reinforcement of ES6 language, was how to apply styling elements through React.  It is not specifically as straightforward as I initially thought, as there was a combination of elements required to the css pages, in addition to the inline styling elements through `className`, and the bitter lessons taught from the code not rendering properly.

Also, each setState element exists on its own.  I cannot use a comma to connect multiple elements.  That's 2 hours of my life researching a bug that I won't get back.
